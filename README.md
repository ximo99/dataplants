# dataplants
The project aims to develop a mobile application for the registration and recognition of flora species from around the world. The developed product has a collaborative approach through which the users themselves have the possibility not only to consult the information, but also to add new ones, contributing to create a richer and more complete content of the application. For the identification of plants, the comparison of histograms has been proposed. In addition, the application includes functionalities such as allowing users to explore the database being able to access the information using different filters- or the inclusion of new plants, among others. With an eye on greater interaction between users, the possibility of adding publications in which users can report the discovery of species in the natural environment has been included. It is important to highlight that the project seeks to be an alternative for experts and amateurs to botany, make unknown flora species known to the general public, as well as promote awareness of respect for the biodiversity of ecosystems. In short, DataPlants is a collaborative mobile application designed to offer users the possibility of exploring and learning about the natural environment through the identification and search of plants.
